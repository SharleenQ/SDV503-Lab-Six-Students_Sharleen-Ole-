## Task two: 
Helped by jordan-
+ for this task i couldn't start the functions and find the correct loop that wasn't the same as the one displayed on NDM. Jordan helped us changing ours to be a little more original and helped me think outside the box. He helped me to dissect the code to explain the looping process and that its adding 2 to x with i declared to be 0, this was giving out a odd number array. was really cool making code change to what i want.
 we used 10 is our maximum in the loop and we played around to change the output to be odd numbers or even.  

 was really nie to understand the code we are creating however when i look at my completed code i still dont understand how to decide from the other loops what was suitable fo this result. as time goes on and wee move on to the next task. i look forward to what i will use from this task and learn for the next.

## Task three:
starting ... HELP is all i could think but as i read the three "must includes" i started to complete the code in my head i was still off topic thinking we were going to be using this code.

let object = {a: 1,b: 2, c: 3,};
    for (let key of Object.keys(object))
