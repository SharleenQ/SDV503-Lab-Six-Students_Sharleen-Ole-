### Sharleen's Journal

## Task ones:
i wrote about task 1 last.. ALI... omggggg this was so hard !!!!

i honestly pulled ,y hair out and we spent almost 5 hrs on this one task.. YES, i need to try understand and study.. but also i felt like the research was really off topic i didn't know how to read / problem solve.
I struggled allot.
//But after you helped us with writing out the problem then in the lunch room you explained it in detail your enthusiasm made me want to try harder. i don't like to upset/disappoint you or my team mates.

 week 5 code snippet: 
 Tuesday 23rd Learning about loops.

```for(i= 0; i <= 5; i++) {    console.log('this is a loop') let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
console.log(arr.length)
```

```for (let i = 0;; i++) {  console.log("loop, i = " + i); if (i > 1)  break;};
```

```let counter =0;
function inc() { counter++; } for (let i = 0; i <10; i++, inc()); console.log(counter); 
```

## Task two: 
Helped by jordan-
 for this task i couldn't start the functions and find the correct loop that wasn't the same as the one displayed on NDM. Jordan helped us changing ours to be a little more original and helped me think outside the box. He helped me to dissect the code to explain the looping process and that its adding 2 to x with i declared to be 0, this was giving out a odd number array. was really cool making code change to what i want.
 we used 10 is our maximum in the loop and we played around to change the output to be odd numbers or even.  

 was really nie to understand the code we are creating however when i look at my completed code i still don't understand how to decide from the other loops what was suitable fo this result. as time goes on and wee move on to the next task. i look forward to what i will use from this task and learn for the next.

## Task three:
starting with... HELP.

and that is all i could think about for a good thirty minutes ..but as i read the three "Notes on the todo list and what the answer needs to included" i started to complete the code in my head. i was still off topic a little, and went through my gihhub saved branches and went through week 7 and found this code. it got me thinking we were going to be using this code. Jordan mention "count" and thats when i went into count on 

```let object = {a: 1,b: 2, c: 3,};
    for (let key of Object.keys(object)) 

Im lucky jordan was there for help he was explaining that we were needing to "count" the likes and dislikes. 
I guessed the function would use the '+,- or even *' to find a answer but in this case i went with '-' and i remembered back to my previous task i used '+=' to add 2 so i asked him if we could use '-=' he was surprised and said YESSS... yay me im now catching on with small things that can be added to the functions .. i also asked about the placing the dot notation.
