### Ole's Journal

## Task 1:
we spent have spent about 5 hrs doing research that was really off topic and got confused.
Eventually we got help with the code snippet you gave us and writing out the problem then in the lunch room you explained it in detail.

your piece of art work
 week 5 code snippet: 
 Tuesday 23rd Learning about loops.

```for(i= 0; i <= 5; i++) {    console.log('this is a loop') let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
console.log(arr.length)
```

```for (let i = 0;; i++) {  console.log("loop, i = " + i); if (i > 1)  break;};
```

```let counter =0;
function inc() { counter++; } for (let i = 0; i <10; i++, inc()); console.log(counter); 
```

## Task 2: 
At this point we got help by jordan-
Jordan helped us changing our code to be a little more original.
 we got 10 as our maximum in the loop and played around to change the output to be odd numbers or even.  
 As time went on and we move on to the next task.

## Task 3:
We got started with getting help
and started reading "Notes on the todo list and what the answer needs to included"i still off was off topic for a while, and searched through my github to find some useful code snippet. At some point Jordan mention "count".
```let object = {a: 1,b: 2, c: 3,};
    for (let key of Object.keys(object)) 

By pure luck jordan was there to help he explained that we needed to "count" the likes and dislikes. 
The function wasn't going to use the '+,- or even *' to find a answer but '+=' or '-='.
