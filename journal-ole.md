## Task 1:
task 1 was hard

we spent about 5 hrs on this one task and the research was really off topic i didn't know how to read / problem solve.
I personally struggled allot.
after you helped us with writing out the problem then in the lunch room you explained it in detail i understood some things

 week 5 code snippet: 
 Tuesday 23rd Learning about loops.

```for(i= 0; i <= 5; i++) {    console.log('this is a loop') let arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
console.log(arr.length)
```

```for (let i = 0;; i++) {  console.log("loop, i = " + i); if (i > 1)  break;};
```

```let counter =0;
function inc() { counter++; } for (let i = 0; i <10; i++, inc()); console.log(counter); 
```

## Task 2: 
We got help by jordan-
 for this task i couldn't start the functions and find the correct loop that wasn't the same as the one displayed on NDM. Jordan helped us changing ours to be a little more original.
 we used 10 is our maximum in the loop and we played around to change the output to be odd numbers or even.  
 As time goes on and we move on to the next task.

## Task 3:
We got started with getting help

and that is all we could think about, but as i read the three "Notes on the todo list and what the answer needs to included" i started to complete
the code in my head. i was still off topic for a while, and went through my github saved branches and went through week 7 and found this code. it got me thinking we were going 
to be using this code. Jordan mention "count" and thats when i went into count on 

```let object = {a: 1,b: 2, c: 3,};
    for (let key of Object.keys(object)) 

we got lucky jordan was there for help he was explaining that we were needing to "count" the likes and dislikes. 
we guessed the function would use the '+,- or even *' to find a answer but in this case it was '+=' or '-='.
